# MapGallery

I could not find an image viewer which supports slideshows mixing photos with maps, so I created my own. It's designed for offline usage, but also works online.

Try it now at http://zoo.li/MapGallery

## Controls

Next photo: right arrow, down arrow, click

Prev photo: left arrow, up arrow

## Instructions

1. Download and unzip the .zip file or clone the repo.
2. Copy your photos to the /images folder
3. Edit scripts/demo.js
4. Access the index.html page.

## Options

see MapGallery.js and MapAnimator.js

### Stuff used to make this:

 * [geocodezip](http://www.geocodezip.com/) - Map animation is based on a script from there
 * [Moyan Brenn](https://www.flickr.com/photos/aigle_dore/) - Demo photos about Rome
 * [echiner1](https://www.flickr.com/photos/decadence/) - Demo photo about Pisa
